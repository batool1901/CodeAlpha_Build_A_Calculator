# CodeAlpha_Build_A_Calculator
In this project, I built a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed specifically to help beginners who have foundational knowledge of these technologies. The calculator allows users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
